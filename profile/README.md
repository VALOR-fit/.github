[VALOR is a neutrino oscillation analysis group](https://valor.pp.rl.ac.uk) 
established within the T2K experiment in 2010.
From 2010 to 2024, the VALOR group led numerous flagship T2K oscillation analyses, 
delivered world-leading results on behalf of the collaboration, and contributed to the 
majority of published T2K oscillation papers. 
A detailed overview of VALOR’s extensive contributions to T2K oscillation analysis 
can be found [here](https://hep.ph.liv.ac.uk/~costasa/valor/#results_t2k).

Out of this effort came the *VALOR Software Development Kit (SDK)*, 
a powerful, flexible, experiment-agnostic, well-validated, and optimised neutrino analysis framework. 
Using the VALOR SDK, our group has implemented 
atmospheric neutrino oscillation / neutrino mass-ordering analyses in [JUNO](http://juno.ihep.cas.cn/),
analyses for sterile neutrino searches at the [Fermilab SBN program](https://sbn.fnal.gov/),
as well as for sensitivity evaluation and design optimisation studies for future experiments, such as DUNE and HyperK.

## Respositories hosted in this GitHub organization

Currently, all codes in the repositories hosted in this GitHub organization are closed source :key:.
